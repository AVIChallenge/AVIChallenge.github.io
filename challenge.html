                AVI Challenge 2025 consists of two tracks: the <a href="challenge.html#PS">personality assessment track</a> and the <a href="challenge.html#IPA">interview performance assessment track</a>. Track 1 focuses on evaluating subjects' personality traits based on their responses to corresponding <b>personality questions</b>. Track 2 concentrates on using multimodal information from subjects' responses to <b>all questions (i.e., including both generic and personality questions)</b> to assess their job-related competencies and interview performance.

                <h3>Subjects</h3>  <a name="subject"></a>
                <uL>
                    <LI>The dataset consisted of video interview data from 644 subjects (307 men, 309 women, 28 non-binary). Subjects (<i>n = 793</i>) were recruited through the online platform Prolific. After excluding subjects (a) with incomplete responses (<i>n = 40</i>), (b) who did not consent for their data to be shared (<i>n = 10</i>), (c) who did not pass the attention checks (<i>n = 7</i>), (d) whose variation in personality (HEXACO) items was either too large or too small (<i>n = 6</i>), (e) who self-reported that they did not take the study seriously (<i>n = 12</i>), (f) whose videos contained corrupted audio (<i>n = 51</i>), (g) and who were flagged by personality raters as non-compliant (<i>n = 23</i>), the final sample size consisted of 644 subjects.

                <h3>Procedure</h3>  <a name="procedure"></a>
                <uL>
                    <LI>Subjects applied to a fictitious management traineeship position. Part of the application procedure was to complete an AVI using a platform we developed for the purpose of the study. During the AVI, subjects responded to six interview questions. Two of them were <b><i>generic questions</i></b>, frequently asked in selection interviews. The other four questions were related to the personality traits of <b>Honesty-Humility</b>, <b>Extraversion</b>, <b>Agreeableness</b>, and <b>Conscientiousness</b>, as described by the HEXACO model of personality (i.e, the <b><i>personality questions</i></b>). Subjects were instructed to reply within 1-2 minutes to the interview questions.
                </uL>
                <p></p>

                <h3>Interview question development</h3>  <a name="iqd"></a>
                <ul>
                    <li>The interview followed a structured format, since previous literature suggests that structured (vs. non- or semi-structured) interviews have stronger reliability and validity. Subjects always started with the generic questions and proceeded to the personality questions. <a href="challenge.html#tb1">Table 1</a> shows the content, order and type of the six questions and their corresponding personality traits.
                        <uL>
                            <li> <b>Generic questions.</b> 
                                For the development of generic interview questions, we created an initial pool of 86 job interview questions taken from previous literature and a list of frequently asked interview questions provided by a Dutch consultancy company. As a first step, we screened those questions for eligibility. Questions were included if they were (a) open-ended, (b) conveyed personality information to some extent, and (c) could apply to multiple jobs. Questions were excluded if they described specific behaviors, specific jobs, or knowledge, values, and motives. This procedure ended up in retaining 61 questions. 
                                To assess those 61 questions, we asked 17 professional recruiters from a Dutch consultancy company to assess how frequently they use each of those questions in practice. Responses were given on a 3-point scale. The inter-rater agreement between the recruiters was <i>ICC(2,17) = 0.88</i>. We then asked four personality experts to assess each interview question on a 7-point scale using three criteria. Namely, whether the questions applied to limited or multiple jobs, whether they activated one or more personality traits, as well as provide a general assessment <i>(ICC(2,4) = 0.66)</i>. Then, we calculated the average score per criterion (professional recruiters, personality experts) and excluded all questions that scored below the average (per criterion). This process returned 16 questions which (a) were frequently used by practitioners, (b) were not specific to a particular job, and (c) activated more than one personality traits. Of those 16 questions, we slightly edited and selected two questions that received the highest ratings from recruiters and personality experts.
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Personality questions.</b> 
                                For the development of personality interview questions, we created an initial pool of 25 past behavior interview questions for the personality traits of Honesty-Humility (<i>n = 6</i>), Extraversion (<i>n = 8</i>), Agreeableness (<i>n = 5</i>), and Conscientiousness (<i>n = 6</i>). The questions were developed to target the core facets of each personality trait. Questions were developed in a past-behavior formal (e.g., “Think of situations when…”) since this type of format are more suited to elicit personality-relevant information according to previous research. 
                                Four personality experts independently selected one question per personality trait and later discussed any disagreements between them until a consensus was reached, retaining one question per personality trait. After some further editing, we ended up with four personality-related questions (<a href="challenge.html#tb1">Table 1</a>).

                    <li><b>Personality traits. </b>
                        Observer reports of personality were provided by a group of 12 raters. Raters followed a 9-hour training. Each subject received eight independent personality ratings. Responses were provided using a Behavioral Anchored Response Scale. The BARS contained four items per personality domain (one item per facet), and responses were given on a 5-point scale (1 = Very low; 5 = Very high), allowing to register up to one decimal point. Personality domain scores were calculated after averaging the four facet scores per domain, across the eight ratings. The inter-rater agreement ranged from ICC(1,8) = 0.61 (Honesty-Humility) to ICC(1,8) = 0.83 (Extraversion).

                    <li><b>Interview performance.</b>
                        The job-related competencies were annotated by a group of five professional recruiters. The raters followed a 3-hour training. Raters assessed five job competencies and one overall hireability score after having watched all six interview questions (raters manually rotated the order of questions to avoid ordering effects). The five job competencies were taken from the manual of a Dutch consultancy company. The definitions of the four competencies are shown below:

                <uL>
                    <LI>The dataset used for the challenge is split into training (70%, <i>n = 450</i>), validation (10%, <i>n = 64</i>), and testing (20%, <i>n = 130</i>) sets. The training and validation sets will be made available to participants for algorithm development. The dataset is divided at the subject level, ensuring that videos from a single subject are assigned exclusively to one of the training, validation, or testing sets. Although the input videos differ between the two tracks (i.e., track 1 uses only videos for answering personality questions, while track 2 uses videos for answering all questions), the split remains consistent across both tracks of our challenge. In splitting the dataset, we consider the distribution of gender, age, and working experience of the subjects. Specifically, we employ joint sampling to ensure that these three sets maintain similar distributions of these demographic and experiential variables. The gender, age, working experience distribution of the training, validation and testing sets are shown in <a href="challenge.html#fig1">Figure 1</a>.

                </header>

                <p>In this track, you will develop models and algorithms to assess personality traits based on subjects' responses to the questions which are designed by psychologists to activate the corresponding personality traits. The task of this track is a <b>single-input-single-label regression task</b>. Below is an example for training models:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Input video: </b>
                        “5484821efdf99b07b28f2300_q3_personality.mp4”
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Corresponding personality trait: </b>
                        q3->Honesty-Humanity
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Label (personality trait): </b>
                        3.5
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The range of the personality trait ratings is [1,5]. Please note that you may also use videos which contain information from other personality traits for recognition. However, it should be stated clearly in the report you submit.

                <p>In this track, you are tasked with developing models and algorithms to evaluate five job-related competencies (i.e., Integrity, Collegiality, Social versatility, Development orientation and Overall hireability) using videos in which subjects respond to both generic and personality questions. The task of this track is a <b>multi-input-multi-label regression task</b>. The range of the job-related competencies ratings is also [1,5] Below is an example for training models:</p>

                    <li>Q: How to deal with the spotted intervals with overlap? <br/>
                        A: We consider that each ground-truth interval corresponds to at most one single spotted
                        interval. If your algorithm detects multiple with overlap, you should merge them into an optimal
                        interval. The fusion method is also part of your algorithm, and the final result evaluation only
                        cares about the optimal interval obtained.
                    </li>

                    <li>Q: For the STR challenge, how many classes are used in the classification part? <br/>
                        A: You are required to only classify emotions into three classes: <code>"negative"</code>, <code>"positive"</code>, <code>"surprise"</code>. 
                        Only correctly spotted micro-expressions are passed on to the classification part, also knowns as Analysis (on the Leaderboard).
                        The <code>"other"</code> class is <b>not included</b> in the evaluation calculation for the Analysis part. However, all occurrences, including those labelled 
                        with the <code>"other"</code> class are considered in the Spotting part as they are micro-expressions.
                    </li>
